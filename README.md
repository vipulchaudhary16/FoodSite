# FoodSite
I made a Simple Food delivery site with HTML and CSS


I hope You are doing well!

So, It was the time when I just started to learn Web Development from Youtube and There I got One project, was too excited!
I spend my time 2 days on that project and finally, I did it.

I took advice from my friend also took some photos which are used on this site, cause He(@harshvarmora28) is very good at Photoshop.

I used only basic CSS for this site like flex display, positions, display block, etc...

I added three divs in one div to illustrate the Items we offer.

also another three sponsors also there

It was too funny for using the Ballo bhai fontðŸ˜‚.

End this site with a footer.
